## How to use the SDK?
The complete source code is available in this repository folder. You can either directly use it in your project via source code or get [Packagist distribution](https://packagist.org/packages/aspose-cloud/aspose-words-cloud) (recommended). For more details, please visit our [documentation website](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/wordscloud/Available+SDKs).

### Prerequisites

To use Aspose Words Cloud PHP SDK you need to register an account with [Aspose Cloud](https://www.aspose.cloud/) and lookup/create App Key and SID at [Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps). There is free quota available. For more details, see [Aspose Cloud Pricing](https://purchase.aspose.cloud/pricing).

### Installation

#### Via Composer:
*aspose-words-cloud* is available on Packagist as the
[`aspose-words-cloud`](https://packagist.org/packages/aspose-cloud/aspose-words-cloud) package. Run the following command:
```bash
composer require aspose-cloud/aspose-words-cloud
```

To use the SDK, use Composer's [autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#autoloading):

```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
```

## Dependencies
- PHP 7.1 or later
- referenced packages (see [here](composer.json) for more details)

## Comparison with Old generation SDK
New SDK has the following advantages over the [previous version](https://github.com/aspose-words/Aspose.Words-for-Cloud):
+ SDK is fully in sync with the API, all missing methods are added
+ Classes, methods and properties have comments and are IDE-friendly
+ Better security
+ Usage of Request/Response classes to represent long lists of parameters. This allows for cleaner code and easier backwards-compatibility going forward

New SDK is not backwards compatible with previous generation because of the last item. It should be straightforward to convert your code to using Request/Response objects, if you need any help on migration please ask at [Free Support Forums](https://forum.aspose.cloud/c/words).

### Sample usage

```php
        // Start README example

        $api = new WordsApi($clientId, $clientSecret);
        // the step is optional, the default value is https://api.aspose.cloud
        $api->getConfig()->setHost($baseUrl);

        // upload file to cloud
        $upload_request = new Requests\UploadFileRequest($localFilePath, 'fileStoredInCloud.doc');
        $upload_result = $api->uploadFile($upload_request);

        // save as pdf file
        $saveOptions = new SaveOptionsData(array("save_format" => "pdf", "file_name" => 'destination.pdf'));
        $request = new Requests\SaveAsRequest('fileStoredInCloud.doc', $saveOptions);
        $result = $api->saveAs($request);

        // End README example
```

[Tests](tests/Aspose/Words) contain various examples of using the SDK.
